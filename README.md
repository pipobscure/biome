# @pipobscure/biome

These are my [biome](https://www.npmjs.org/package/@biomejs/biome) defaults shared across all my projects.
To init in a project simply run `npm exec @pipobscure/biome init` after installing this as a devDependency
which will modify/create a `biome.json` file.

After that use biome as normally.
